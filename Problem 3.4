find method ( some hashvalue, some element1){

for(from start of list until end of list)
{
  if(hashvalue is found){
  add element to a list
  }
}
for(traverse the list of elements with the same hashvalues){
if(element1 = some element in the list){
return that element's positon in the original list
}
}
}

My algorithm would be a O(n^2) complexity since I would have to traverse the list once
to find all of the same hash values then in the worst case I would have to traverse the 
entire list again if all the hash values were the same in order to find the desired element.
